# Installation
Before installation, it's recommended to first activate a [virtualenv](https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv) to 
not crowd your system's package library. If you don't use any of the dependencies listed above, 
this step is less important. `swmmio` can be installed via pip in your command line:

```console
pip install swmmio
```
