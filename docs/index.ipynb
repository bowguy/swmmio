    "## Introduction\n",
    "`swmmio` is a Python tool for engineers and hydrologists who need to supercharge their ability to modify and analyze EPA SWMM models and results. Using a familiar Pandas interface, users can replace manual procesess that used to live in spreadsheets with scripts and automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core {py:class}`~swmmio.core.Model` object provides accessors to related elements in the INP and RPT. For example, the {py:obj}`Model.subcatchments <swmmio.core.Model.subcatchments>` property provides a {py:obj}`~pandas.DataFrame` (or GeoDataFrame) accessor joining data from the `[SUBCATCHMENTS]` and `[SUBAREAS]` tables in the model.inp file and, if available, the `Subcatchment Runoff Summary` from the model.rpt file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, `swmmio` provides a lower-level {py:class}`~swmmio.core.inp` API for reading and writing (almost) all of the sections of the model.inp file which is useful for programmatically modifying EPA SWMM models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install swmmio\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "For more examples and tutorials, see the [User Guide](usage/index.md) section."
