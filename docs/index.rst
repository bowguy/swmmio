`swmmio` provides a Pythonic interface to the EPA Stormwater Management Model (SWMM)
allowing engineers to programmatically create, modify, and
analyze SWMM models.

With `swmmio`, model parameters encoded in the `.inp` file can be
retrieved conveniently as Pandas dataframes making it possible to
automate your hydraulics and hydologic modeling workflow. After simulations are
completed, results in the `.rpt` file can also be retrieved as Pandas dataframes,
making post-processing automation trivial.
